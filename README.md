# AQWebsite


This is a website project that I had to do for HTML/CSS classes at DCU (Dublin City University)

It consists on using the web.archive.org site to see how a website was back on 2008/2009 and re do it 
with the modern technology available today.

This website is from a old and very famous MMO game, AdventureQuest World.
